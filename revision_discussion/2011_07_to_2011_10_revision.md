# July 2011 to October 2011 Revision

Only minor changes in this revision (which comes only a few months after the last one). Other than minor typo fixes, the changes are:

- Removal of "Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Product Backlog Items. The work remaining and date are the only variables of interest."
- In the section on the Sprint, "quality goals remain constant" has been changed to "quality goals do not decrease."
- New service for the Scrum Master: "Teaching the Development/Scrum Team to create clear and concise Product Backlog items."
